# Machine Intelligence at Biolab website

## Developing the project:

1. Download Jekyll (it should be available for every major Linux distribution via the default package manager). If Jekyll is not available follow the instructions [here](https://jekyllrb.com/)
2. `cd <project folder>` and then `jekyll serve`. If no error is detected you should see a local copy of the site at the address `127.0.0.1:4000`.
3. Change style (folder `_sass`), layout (folder `_layouts`), general information (file `_config.yml`), add a new post (folder `_posts`) or add new pages.
4. Commit your changes (**make small commits!**) and push to master.
5. The site should go online in few seconds, at `mi-biolab.github.io`. If you don't see any change include the last version number (e.g. `https://mi-biolab.github.io/?version=7d29966`). The version number can be found in the tab environment on the github repo.
