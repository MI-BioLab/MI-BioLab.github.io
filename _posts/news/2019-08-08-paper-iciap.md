#### Gesture Recognition by Leap Motion Controller and LSTM Networks for CAD-oriented Interfaces

**Lisa Mazzini, Annalisa Franco, Davide Maltoni**

This paper presents a gesture recognition approach for CAD interfaces where the Leap Motion Controller is used for its high precision in modeling user hands. A simple, compact and effective hand representation is proposed to encode trajectory and pose across time. Recognition is based on Recurrent Neural Networks, particularly suited for processing data sequences. An effective data augmentation technique is also described to increase the size of the training set. Experiments conducted on a novel dataset of gesture performed by 30 volunteers show the effectiveness of the proposed technique; the dataset will be made available to the community for future studies.
